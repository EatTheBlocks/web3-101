/*
Create a contract and make it so that you can call any functions whether they exist or not. 
If the function does not exist, you should set the value of “num” to the amount of Ether sent 
to the function.  For example, there is a way to call a function called “hello()” even if the 
function “hello()” does not exist in the contract. Also, make it so that you can send Ether to 
the contract. Hint: Use special functions available in Solidity to achieve this.
